# MMTB
The [Metano Modeling Toolbox (MMTB)](https://mmtb.brenda-enzymes.org) is a web-based toolbox that assists during model creation and analysis.
Many Metano tools (FBA, FVA, split-ratio, ...) can be used via MMTB without installation. Furthermore, MMTB offers different visualizations for your metabolic models, and a platform for the distribution of models.
