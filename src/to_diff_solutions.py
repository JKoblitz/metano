""" This script computes the absolute difference between two flux distributions
    given as FBA solution files.

Usage:

    to_diff_solutions.py <file1> <file2> [-o output-file] [-c cutoff]

The output is written to the console if no output file is given.
Output format is as follows (without header):
<NAME>    <DIFFERENCE>

Reactions are sorted in order of decreasing flux difference. Reactions in which
the fluxes differ by less than cutoff are omitted.
