        # MMTB
        The [Metano Modeling Toolbox (MMTB)](http://mmtb.tu-bs.de) is a web-based toolbox that assists during model creation and analysis.
        Many Metano tools (FBA, FVA, split-ratio, ...) can be used via MMTB without installation.
        Furthermore, MMTB offers different visualizations for your metabolic models.
